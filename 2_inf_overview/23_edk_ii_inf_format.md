## 2.3 EDK II INF Format

The remainder of this chapter describes the EDK II INF file format.

**********
**Note:** EDK II accommodates distribution of binary modules, so in addition to
handling standard module builds, the INF can also specify information about a
binary module.
**********

EDK II INF files may be created by package installation tools using the UEFI
Distribution Package description files that accompany a distribution package.

All content (except section tag names) within the EDK II INF file is
case-sensitive. All newly created EDK II INF files must be written to be
case-sensitive.
