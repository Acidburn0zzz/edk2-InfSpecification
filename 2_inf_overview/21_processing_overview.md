## 2.1 Processing Overview

Each module or component INF file is broken out into sections in a manner
similar to the other build meta-data files. However, the intent of a module's
INF file is to define the source files, libraries, and definitions relevant to
building the module, creating binary files that are either raw binary files or
PE32/PE32+/coff format files. The different sections are described in detail in
this chapter. In general, the original EDK parsing utilities read each line
from the `[Libraries]` or `[Components]` sections of the build description
(DSC) file, process the INF file on a line to generate a makefile, and then
continued with the next line. EDK II parsing utilities are token based, which
permits an element to span multiple lines. The EDK II utilities check both EDK
and EDK II INF files, and, if required, generate C code files based on the
content of the EDK II INF. Refer to the _EDK II Build Specification_ for more
information regarding these autogenerated files.

One major difference between EDK and EDK II is support for non-Microsoft
development environments. Because modules may be distributed to developers that
use these environments, both source code and the meta-data files need to be
UNIX*/ GCC clean. One little known fact regarding the Microsoft tools and
operating systems is their ability to process the forward slash "/" character
as a directory separator.

All EDK II INF files MUST use this forward slash character for all directory
paths specified.
